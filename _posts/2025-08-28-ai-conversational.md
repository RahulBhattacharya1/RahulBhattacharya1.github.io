I wanted to build something lightweight yet useful—a conversational morning planner that runs locally and feels personal. The idea was simple:

*   A **Planner tab** where I could fill in some details and get a neat morning plan.
    
*   A **Chat tab** where I could type natural language like _“run 20 minutes this evening”_ and the bot would update my plan instantly.
    

And to make it smarter, I added a compact embedding model that picks a **relevant focus tip** for my goals. No API keys, no heavy infrastructure.

Demo Goals
----------

*   **Planner tab**: fill a simple form → get a structured morning plan.
    
*   **Chat tab**: type natural phrases (like _“walk fast only”_) → the bot updates activity, intensity, duration, and time.
    
*   A small AI embedding layer → suggests the most relevant focus tip.
    

Requirements
------------

I created a requirements.txt with the basics:

```python
gradio>=4.0.0
torch
sentence-transformers
```
When building a lightweight conversational planner, I wanted to make setup and deployment as simple as possible. That’s why I created a requirements.txt file to lock in the essential dependencies. This file tells any environment—whether it’s my laptop, a cloud runtime, or Hugging Face Spaces—exactly which Python libraries are needed to run the app.

I kept the list short and purposeful. The first dependency, Gradio (>=4.0.0), is the framework that powers the user interface. It makes it easy to design the Planner and Chat tabs with textboxes, dropdowns, and buttons, while handling state and chat history without much boilerplate code. Next is Torch, which provides the deep learning backend required by modern models. Even though the planner is lightweight, Torch is the foundation that allows the embedding model to run locally. Finally, I included sentence-transformers, the library that gives me access to compact, high-quality embedding models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2. This is what makes the app “smart,” enabling it to interpret natural language and suggest the most relevant focus tip.

By limiting requirements to just these essentials, I ensured the app is easy to install, reproducible, and deployable without unnecessary overhead.

Folder Layout
-------------

Just two files were enough:

```python
.
├── app.py
└── requirements.txt
```
To keep things simple, I structured the entire project with just two files: app.py and requirements.txt. This minimal setup was intentional. The app.py file contains all of the application logic—imports, the embedding model, helper functions, the planner generator, the conversational parser, and finally the Gradio UI. In other words, it’s the single script that defines how both the Planner and Chat tabs work, from parsing natural language to rendering the interface.

The second file, requirements.txt, is equally important. It lists the exact Python dependencies the app needs (gradio, torch, and sentence-transformers). When anyone installs or deploys the project, this file ensures the same libraries and versions are pulled in automatically, making the build consistent across environments.

This minimal layout also makes deployment to Hugging Face Spaces painless. Spaces only needs to see an app.py file to know what to execute, and a requirements.txt file to know what to install. Once uploaded, I just had to set app.py as the app file in the Space settings, and everything worked out of the box. By avoiding extra files and folders, the project stays lightweight, portable, and easy to share.

How It Works (High-Level)
-------------------------

1.  **Data & Model**
    
    *   I defined a set of short, practical **focus tips**.
        
    *   Loaded a small embedding model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
        
    *   Precomputed embeddings for tips so matching was instant.
        
2.  **Planner tab**
    
    *   Input fields: name, timezone, energy, wake time, top priorities, note.
        
    *   If AI toggle was on, embeddings picked the best tip.
        
    *   Output was a Markdown plan.
        
3.  **Chat tab**
    
    *   Used regex + synonyms for parsing, with embeddings as fallback.
        
    *   Maintained state for activity, intensity, duration, time of day, energy, notes.
        
    *   Responded with friendly acknowledgments and follow-ups.
        

The Code, Piece by Piece
------------------------

### 1) Imports, Constants, and the Embedding Model

```python
import os, re, random, textwrap
from datetime import datetime, date
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
import gradio as gr
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

FOCUS_TIPS = [
"Work in 25-minute Focus sprints (Pomodoro), then 5-minute breaks.",
"Silence notifications for 60 minutes and batch-check messages afterward.",
"Write your top 3 outcomes for the day before opening email.",
"If it takes <2 minutes, do it now—otherwise schedule it.",
"Tackle the hardest task first while energy is highest.",
"Stand up, stretch, sip water every hour to keep energy up.",
"Use a single-tab rule while doing deep work.",
]

ENERGY_HINTS = {
"Low": "Keep the first block light. Add a short walk + 5 deep breaths before starting.",
"Medium": "Start with a quick win task to build momentum, then move to your #1 priority.",
"High": "Go straight to your hardest task for 60–90 minutes—protect this time!",
}

COMMON_TIMEZONES = [
"America/Chicago","America/New_York","America/Los_Angeles",
"Europe/London","Europe/Berlin","Europe/Paris",
"Asia/Kolkata","Asia/Singapore","Asia/Tokyo","Australia/Sydney"
]
```
The first part of the code sets up the foundation for the planner by importing essential libraries and defining key constants. The imports are deliberately lightweight: os, re, random, and textwrap handle system tasks, regex parsing, randomness, and neat formatting. From the standard library, datetime and zoneinfo ensure the app can display time correctly in different user-selected time zones. On top of that, I use Gradio for the user interface and sentence-transformers for embedding-based intelligence.

Next, I defined **FOCUS_TIPS**, a curated list of short, practical reminders that users might find helpful while planning their day—things like Pomodoro breaks, single-tasking, or protecting deep work time. These tips form the “knowledge base” that the AI embedding model will later match against the user’s stated goals.

The **ENERGY_HINTS** dictionary provides context-sensitive suggestions depending on how energized the user feels (Low, Medium, High). This makes the plan more personalized, since productivity advice should adapt to the user’s state.

Finally, COMMON_TIMEZONES is a small set of popular time zones. This ensures users can localize their plan no matter where they are, without scrolling through an overwhelming list of every possible timezone. Together, these constants act as the backbone of the planner’s personalization.

```python
_MODEL = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
_TIP_EMB = _MODEL.encode(FOCUS_TIPS, normalize_embeddings=True)
```
At this stage, I load the embedding model and prepare it for fast, repeated use. I chose sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a compact but powerful embedding model that strikes a good balance between accuracy and performance. At around 80–90 MB, it’s small enough to run locally or in free-tier environments like Hugging Face Spaces, while still providing high-quality semantic understanding.

Once the model is loaded, I immediately precompute embeddings for the list of **FOCUS_TIPS**. Embeddings are vector representations that capture the meaning of each tip. By computing these vectors just once at startup, I avoid recalculating them every time the user interacts with the app. This drastically improves responsiveness—when a user types in their goals, the app only needs to embed that single query and compare it to the pre-stored tip embeddings, rather than embedding all tips again.

The normalization step (normalize_embeddings=True) ensures that cosine similarity scores are meaningful and consistent across comparisons. With everything preprocessed, the system can instantly suggest the most relevant tip that matches the user’s context or goals. This setup turns a static list of tips into a smart, AI-driven recommendation engine with virtually no runtime overhead.

### 2) Minimal AI Helper

```python
def _ai_pick_best(items_emb, query_text):
if not query_text or not query_text.strip():
return None
q_emb = _MODEL.encode(query_text, normalize_embeddings=True)
scores = util.cos_sim(q_emb, items_emb)[0]
return int(scores.argmax())
```
The function _ai_pick_best is a compact utility that powers the “intelligence” in the planner. Its job is simple: given a list of precomputed embeddings (such as the FOCUS_TIPS) and a user’s input, it figures out which option best matches the meaning of the query.

The function begins with a quick safeguard: if the input text is empty or only whitespace, it immediately returns None. This avoids unnecessary computation and prevents errors when the user hasn’t typed anything meaningful.

If there is valid input, the function encodes it into an embedding using the same model we loaded earlier (_MODEL). By normalizing the embeddings, we ensure that all comparisons are consistent. Next, it computes cosine similarity between the query embedding and the list of stored embeddings. Cosine similarity is a measure of how close two vectors are in direction, which translates to how similar two pieces of text are in meaning.

Finally, the function returns the index of the highest-scoring match using argmax(). This index corresponds to whichever tip, activity, or energy level is most semantically aligned with the user’s request.

In just a few lines, this helper makes the system context-aware, allowing static lists to feel interactive and personalized.
### 3) Planner: Generate a Morning Plan

```python
def generate_plan(name, tz, energy, wake_time, primary_goal, secondary_goal, extra_note, use_ai):
    seed = int(date.today().strftime("%Y%m%d"))
    random.seed(seed)

    intent = " ".join([s for s in [primary_goal or "", secondary_goal or "", extra_note or ""] if s]).strip()

    if use_ai and intent:
        t_idx = _ai_pick_best(_TIP_EMB, intent)
        tip = FOCUS_TIPS[t_idx]
        ai_badge = " (AI-personalized)"
    else:
        tip = random.choice(FOCUS_TIPS)
        ai_badge = ""

    now_local = datetime.now(ZoneInfo(tz))
    time_str = now_local.strftime("%I:%M %p").lstrip("0")

    blocks = []
    if wake_time:
        blocks.append(f"☀️ **{wake_time}** — Wake, hydrate (250 ml), 5 deep breaths, quick stretch")
    blocks.append("📓 **Morning Prime (10 min)** — Write top 3 outcomes & clear desk")
    blocks.append(f"🎯 **Deep Work (60–90 min)** — Focus on: **{primary_goal or 'your #1 task'}**")
    if secondary_goal:
        blocks.append(f"🔁 **Block 2 (45–60 min)** — Next: **{secondary_goal}**")
    blocks.append("🍎 **Micro-break (5 min)** — Stand up, sip water, quick walk")
    if extra_note:
        blocks.append(f"📝 **Note** — {extra_note}")

    plan_md = "\n".join([f"- {b}" for b in blocks])
    energy_md = ENERGY_HINTS.get(energy, "")
    greeting = f"Good morning{f', {name}' if name else ''}! It’s **{time_str}** in **{tz}**."

    body = f"""
**Today’s vibe:** {energy} energy{ai_badge}  
**Focus tip:** {tip}
### Your Morning Plan
{plan_md}
**Pro tip:** {energy_md}
"""
    return textwrap.dedent(greeting + "\n\n" + body).strip()
```
The generate_plan function is the heart of the structured planner tab. It takes in user inputs—such as name, timezone, energy level, wake time, and top priorities—and returns a clean, Markdown-formatted morning plan.

The function starts by setting a random seed based on today’s date, ensuring that any “random” selections (like fallback tips) stay consistent for that day, but vary across different days. It then constructs an intent string by combining the user’s goals and notes. If AI is enabled and there’s meaningful input, the system uses _ai_pick_best to select the most relevant focus tip. Otherwise, it randomly picks a tip from the list.

Next, the function localizes the time using the user’s chosen timezone, giving the plan a personal touch with a timestamped greeting. It then builds a list of activity blocks—wake-up routine, journaling, deep work, secondary goals, breaks, and optional notes. Each block is formatted with friendly icons and Markdown for easy readability.

The output also integrates energy-based guidance from ENERGY_HINTS, so the advice feels adapted to the user’s current state. Finally, everything is combined into a Markdown string that Gradio can render beautifully in the UI.

This makes the planner both structured and personalized, while still lightweight.
### 4) Conversational Parsing (Chat)

```python
INTENTS = [
"run","walk","yoga","strength","cycle","meditate",
"stretch","read","write","code","study","rest"
]

_INTENT_EMB = _MODEL.encode(INTENTS, normalize_embeddings=True)

_ENERGY_WORDS = ["low","medium","high"]

_ENERGY_EMB = _MODEL.encode(_ENERGY_WORDS, normalize_embeddings=True)
ACTIVITY_SYNS = {
"run": ["run","jog","jogging","tempo"],
"walk": ["walk","brisk walk","stroll"],
"yoga": ["yoga","sun salutation"],
"strength": ["strength","weights","lift","lifting","resistance"],
"cycle": ["cycle","bike","biking","cycling"],
"meditate": ["meditate","meditation","mindfulness"],
"stretch": ["stretch","mobility"],
"read": ["read","reading"],
"write": ["write","writing","journal"],
"code": ["code","coding","program"],
"study": ["study","learn"],
"rest": ["rest","recover","recovery","off"]
}

WORD2ACT = {w: act for act, words in ACTIVITY_SYNS.items() for w in words}
```

### Extraction Helpers

```python
def _extract_numbers_minutes(text):

m = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:min|mins|minute|minutes)\b', text, re.I)
if m: return max(5, min(180, int(m.group(1))))
m = re.search(r'\bfor\s+(\d{1,3})\b', text, re.I)
if m: return max(5, min(180, int(m.group(1))))
m = re.search(r'\b(\d{1,3})\b', text)
if m: return max(5, min(180, int(m.group(1))))

return None
def _extract_time_of_day(text):

t = text.lower()

if "morning" in t: return "morning"
if "noon" in t or "midday" in t: return "midday"

return None
def _choose_intensity(text):

t = text.lower()

if any(w in t for w in ["slow","light","easy","casual"]): return "easy"
if any(w in t for w in ["fast","brisk","hard","intense","tempo","interval"]): return "hard"
if any(w in t for w in ["moderate","steady"]): return "moderate"

return None
```

### Activity Matching

```python
def _match_activity(text):

t = text.lower()

for w in WORD2ACT:
if re.search(rf'\b{re.escape(w)}\b', t):
return WORD2ACT[w]

idx = _ai_pick_best(_INTENT_EMB, t)
return INTENTS[idx] if idx is not None else None
```

### Friendly Acknowledgments & Follow-Ups

```python
def _make_ack(s):
bits = []
if s.get("activity"): bits.append(f"{s['activity']}")
if s.get("intensity"): bits.append(f"{s['intensity']}")
if s.get("duration"): bits.append(f"{s['duration']} min")
if s.get("when"): bits.append(f"in the {s['when']}")
if s.get("energy"): bits.append(f"energy {s['energy']}")
return " • ".join(bits) if bits else "noted"

def _next_question(s):
if not s.get("duration"): return "How many minutes are you thinking? ⏱️"
if not s.get("intensity"): return "Easy, moderate, or hard pace? ⚖️"
if not s.get("when"): return "When would you like to do it—morning, afternoon, or evening? 🕒"
return None
```

### State Updater

```python
def _update_state_from_msg(state, msg):
    s = dict(state)
    t = msg.strip()

    if re.search(r'\b(reset|start over|clear)\b', t, re.I):
        return {
            "activity": None, "intensity": None, "duration": None,
            "when": None, "energy": None, "notes": ""
        }, "All set to start fresh! What do you feel like doing today? 🙂"

    act = _match_activity(t)
    if act: s["activity"] = act

    inten = _choose_intensity(t)
    if inten: s["intensity"] = inten

    dur = _extract_numbers_minutes(t)
    if dur: s["duration"] = dur

    when = _extract_time_of_day(t)
    if when: s["when"] = when

    if re.search(r'\blow\b', t): s["energy"] = "Low"
    elif re.search(r'\bmedium\b', t): s["energy"] = "Medium"
    elif re.search(r'\bhigh\b', t): s["energy"] = "High"

    if re.search(r'\bonly\b', t) and act:
        s["intensity"] = s.get("intensity") or "moderate"

    used = set()
    if act: used |= set(ACTIVITY_SYNS.get(act, [])) | {act}
    if inten: used.add(inten)
    if dur: used.add(str(dur))
    if when: used.add(when)
    if s.get("energy"): used.add(s["energy"].lower())

    leftover_words = [w for w in re.findall(r"\b\w+\b", t.lower()) if w not in used]
    leftover = " ".join(leftover_words).strip()
    if leftover:
        s["notes"] = (s.get("notes", "") + " " + leftover).strip()[:500]

    ack = _make_ack(s)
    ask = _next_question(s)

    opener = random.choice([
        "Got it! 🙌",
        "Nice choice! 💪",
        "Sounds good! ✅",
        "On it! 🚀",
    ])
    text_ack = f"{opener} I captured: {ack}."
    if ask: text_ack += f" {ask}"

    return s, text_ack
```

### Suggestion Builder

```python
def _suggest_plan_from_state(state):
    activity = state.get("activity") or "walk"
    intensity = state.get("intensity") or "moderate"
    duration = state.get("duration") or 30
    when = state.get("when") or "morning"

    tip_idx = _ai_pick_best(_TIP_EMB, f"{activity} {intensity} {duration}min {when}")
    tip = FOCUS_TIPS[tip_idx] if tip_idx is not None else random.choice(FOCUS_TIPS)

    plan = [
        f"🕒 **{when.title()}** — {activity.title()} ({intensity}) for **{duration} min**",
    ]
    if state.get("notes"):
        plan.append(f"📝 Note — {state['notes'][:200]}")

    return "\n".join([f"- {p}" for p in plan]) + f"\n\n**Tip:** {tip}"
```

### Chat Core

```python
def chat_core(message, state, tz):
    if state is None or not isinstance(state, dict):
        state = {"activity": None, "intensity": None, "duration": None, "when": None, "energy": None, "notes": ""}

    first_time = not any(state.values())
    new_state, ack = _update_state_from_msg(state, message)
    suggestion = _suggest_plan_from_state(new_state)

    now_local = datetime.now(ZoneInfo(tz))
    tstr = now_local.strftime("%I:%M %p").lstrip("0")

    if first_time:
        pre = random.choice([
            "Hey! I’m your planning buddy. Tell me what you feel like doing and I’ll shape a quick plan. 🙂",
            "Hi there! Share a goal like “run 20 minutes in the evening” and I’ll sort it out. 🧭",
        ])
        reply = f"{pre}\n\n{ack}\n\n_Current time in **{tz}**: **{tstr}**_\n\n{suggestion}"
    else:
        reply = f"{ack}\n\n_Current time in **{tz}**: **{tstr}**_\n\n{suggestion}"

    return reply, new_state
```

```

### 6) Launching

```python
if os.environ.get("SPACE_ID"):

demo.launch()

else:

if name == "main":

demo.launch()
```

Example Chats
-------------

**You:** I want to run today**Bot:** Got it! I captured: run. How many minutes are you thinking?

**You:** make it 20 minutes, evening, fast only**Bot:** On it! I captured: run • hard • 20 min • in the evening.

**You:** walk only**Bot:** Sounds good! I captured: walk • hard • 20 min • in the evening.

**You:** reset**Bot:** All set to start fresh! What do you feel like doing today? 🙂

Closing Thoughts
------------

*   Make the chat the default if you prefer a fully conversational planner.
    
*   Add custom synonyms to extend activities.
    
*   Adapt Planner blocks to match your daily rhythm.
    
*   The model is ~80–90 MB and downloads once, so subsequent runs are fast.

If you deploy on **Hugging Face Spaces**, set the app file to app.py in Space settings.

Closing tips
------------

*   **Make the chat your default**: hide the Planner tab if you want a pure chat experience.
    
*   **Customize synonyms**: add your own activities and words to ACTIVITY\_SYNS.
    
*   **Change the blocks** in the Planner to match your daily routine (or remove any line you don’t want).
    
*   **Speed**: the embedding model is small (~80–90 MB). On first run it downloads once; subsequent launches are faster.
