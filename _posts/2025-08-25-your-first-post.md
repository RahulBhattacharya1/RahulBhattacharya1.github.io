This is a placeholder post. To publish your own article:

1. Create a new file in the **_posts** folder.
2. Name it like this: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md` (example: `2025-08-25-ai-heat-check-2025.md`).
3. Paste your blog content in Markdown.
4. Commit the file. Your site will update in ~1 minute.

> Tip: You can paste the article we drafted earlier (AI Heat Check 2025) into a new post file.
