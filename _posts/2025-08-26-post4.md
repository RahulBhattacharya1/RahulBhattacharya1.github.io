Data science starts long before a model is trained. Real impact comes from framing a sharp question, hunting down trustworthy data, and shaping it into a clean, reproducible dataset. That means documenting assumptions, building pipelines you can re-run, and writing tiny sanity checks: do customer counts reconcile, are timestamps monotonic, are IDs unique, do totals match the source? Exploratory analysis isn’t decoration; it’s a safety net that catches silent failures. Plot distributions, profile missingness, spot outliers, and simulate edge cases. Most “ML problems” are really data problems wearing fancy hats.

Only then should modeling begin. Start with an explainable baseline—regularized linear models or gradient boosting with conservative defaults—before reaching for deep stacks. Track metrics that map to the decision, not vanity scores. Calibrate probabilities, segment by cohort, and test temporal robustness with out-of-time validation. Favor features that can be computed reliably in production over clever but brittle signals. Package the workflow: version data, code, and parameters; seed randomness; and capture artifacts so results are reproducible. Monitoring is part of the model, not an afterthought—watch for drift, missing values, and distribution shifts from day one. Ship small, measure honestly, and iterate.
