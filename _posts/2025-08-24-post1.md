Great models are built on great features. Feature engineering converts raw events—clicks, purchases, loglines—into signals that summarize behavior at the right time horizon. Begin with timeless transforms: counts, rates, recency, ratios, and rolling statistics. Aggregate by meaningful keys (user, account, store) with windows aligned to decisions (daily, weekly, pay period). For text and images, start simple: TF-IDF or compact embeddings for text; average-pooled vectors for images. Baselines with solid features beat exotic architectures with weak inputs.

Keep features healthy in production. Define data contracts so upstream changes don’t silently break you. Monitor population drift, missingness, and shifts; alert when a feature’s range, mean, or cardinality deviates from training. Build backfills and retraining triggers tied to thresholds that matter. Prefer explainable transformations so stakeholders can debug why a score moved. When complexity is needed, layer it carefully: start with a simple model on strong features, then add interactions, regularization, and ensembling only where they prove incremental value in out-of-time tests. Durable features plus disciplined evaluation create models that last.
