There was a moment when I realized how fragile health can be. I had come across a routine medical camp where many individuals were quietly waiting for their turn. What struck me most was the silent anxiety in the air. People were holding reports that they barely understood. I kept thinking how useful it would be if simple tools existed to guide them in real time. That thought stayed with me, and it gradually shaped into an idea. I wanted to create something that could take raw numbers and give back clarity. The motivation did not come from a sudden spark but from a slow build-up of small observations. I knew that technology could step in where words often fail. Dataset used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes).

When I explored the problem further, diabetes stood out as a silent condition that many overlook. Numbers on glucose, blood pressure, and body mass index are often difficult for individuals to interpret. I wanted to design a lightweight web application that could simplify this process. My approach was not to replace doctors or medical advice but to provide educational insights. The goal was clarity and accessibility, especially for those who may not always have immediate access to clinical expertise. That is how I started shaping this project into a working classifier with a clear and simple interface.

## Requirements File Explanation

I uploaded a `requirements.txt` file to GitHub to make sure the environment installs the correct dependencies. Below is the content:

```python
streamlit>=1.36.0
pandas>=2.0,<2.3
numpy==1.26.4
scikit-learn==1.4.2
skops==0.9.0

```

This file is important because Streamlit Cloud or any platform hosting the application needs to know which versions of libraries are required. By locking versions, I make sure the behavior of my model is consistent across runs. Streamlit provides the interface, Pandas manages tabular data, and NumPy handles numerical arrays. Scikit-learn is the core machine learning library that powered my logistic regression model. Skops is included because it allows me to safely serialize and load the model artifact. Every dependency here plays a role in stabilizing the environment. If one is missing or mismatched, the app may crash or misbehave.

## Application Code: `app.py`

The main script is `app.py`. This is the file Streamlit runs to create the web interface. I explain it block by block.

### Imports and Configuration

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

# skops-safe load
import skops.io as sio

# -------------------------
# App Config
# -------------------------
st.set_page_config(page_title="AI Diabetes Classifier", layout="centered")

st.title("AI Diabetes Classifier")
st.write(
    "Enter clinical values to estimate diabetes risk. "
    "This app uses a logistic regression model trained on your dataset."
)

MODEL_PATH = "models/diabetes_model.skops"

```

I structured this section carefully. The code defines behavior and layout, while the surrounding explanations show why each choice matters. For example, imports set the foundation by pulling in external libraries. The configuration ensures the application title and page settings are clear. The model loader checks for the presence of the serialized object before continuing. The form organizes user inputs in columns to make the interface intuitive. The helper function bundles raw values into a consistent dataframe that matches the training schema. The prediction block executes the model and interprets results into meaningful insights. Each conditional rule provides context-specific recommendations, giving the user not just a number but also a narrative. The disclaimer emphasizes the tool’s educational nature, preventing misuse. By combining code with these safeguards, the app remains transparent and trustworthy.

### Model Loading Function

```python
def load_model():
    if not os.path.exists(MODEL_PATH):
        st.error(
            "Model file not found at 'models/diabetes_model.skops'. "
            "Please upload it to the GitHub repo under models/."
        )
        st.stop()
    model = sio.load(MODEL_PATH, trusted=True)
    return model

model = load_model()

```

### Feature Schema and Input Form

```python
feature_names = [
    "Pregnancies",
    "Glucose",
    "BloodPressure",
    "SkinThickness",
    "Insulin",
    "BMI",
    "DiabetesPedigreeFunction",
    "Age",
]

with st.form("input-form"):
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

    Pregnancies = col1.number_input("Pregnancies", min_value=0, max_value=20, value=1, step=1)
    Glucose = col1.number_input("Glucose (mg/dL)", min_value=0, max_value=300, value=120, step=1)
    BloodPressure = col1.number_input("Blood Pressure (mm Hg)", min_value=0, max_value=200, value=70, step=1)
    SkinThickness = col1.number_input("Skin Thickness (mm)", min_value=0, max_value=100, value=20, step=1)

    Insulin = col2.number_input("Insulin (pmol/L)", min_value=0, max_value=1000, value=80, step=1)
    BMI = col2.number_input("BMI", min_value=0.0, max_value=80.0, value=28.0, step=0.1, format="%.1f")
    DiabetesPedigreeFunction = col2.number_input("Diabetes Pedigree Function", min_value=0.0, max_value=3.0, value=0.5, step=0.01, format="%.2f")
    Age = col2.number_input("Age (years)", min_value=1, max_value=120, value=35, step=1)

    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Predict Risk")

```

### Prediction and Display

```python
if submitted:
    X_input = as_dataframe()

    proba = float(model.predict_proba(X_input)[0, 1])
    pred = int(proba >= 0.5)

    st.subheader("Result")
    st.write(f"Predicted Class: **{pred}** (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)")
    st.write(f"Risk Score: **{proba*100:.1f}%**")

    tips = []
    if Glucose >= 140:
        tips.append("Glucose is elevated; consider medical evaluation and blood sugar control strategies.")
    if BMI >= 30:
        tips.append("BMI is in the obese range; modest weight reduction can lower risk.")
    if BloodPressure >= 90:
        tips.append("Diastolic blood pressure is high; discuss BP management with a clinician.")
    if Insulin == 0 or Insulin >= 200:
        tips.append("Insulin measurement is atypical; ensure proper labs and follow-up.")
    if Age >= 45:
        tips.append("Age is a non-modifiable risk factor; maintain regular screening.")
    if not tips:
        tips.append("Maintain a balanced diet, regular exercise, and periodic screening.")

    st.subheader("Recommendations")
    for t in tips:
        st.write(f"- {t}")

    st.caption(
        "Disclaimer: This tool is for educational purposes and not a medical diagnosis. "
        "Consult a qualified professional for healthcare decisions."
    )

## Model Artifact

The project also includes a serialized model stored as `models/diabetes_model.skops`. This binary file cannot be read directly here, but it contains the logistic regression pipeline trained earlier. It embeds preprocessing steps like scaling and imputation along with the classifier. I uploaded it to GitHub so that the app can load it instantly at runtime without retraining. By separating code from model, I ensured faster startup and consistent predictions. If the model is missing, the app displays an error and stops execution. This prevents misleading behavior.

## Conclusion

This project brought together several skills: data preprocessing, model training, safe serialization, user interface design, and deployment. Each file played a critical role. `requirements.txt` managed the environment, `app.py` powered the interface and logic, and the model artifact ensured reproducibility. I focused on clarity, accessibility, and responsible presentation. Building this classifier was not just a coding exercise but a way to imagine how small tools can give timely insights. The process reaffirmed my belief that even compact projects can make a difference if designed with care.

### Reflections on Design

I spent significant time deciding how to balance transparency with simplicity. A classifier can easily overwhelm a user with technical terminologies. My decision was to hide complexity while exposing meaningful numbers like probability and binary classification. This project also reflects my attention to deployment details. By packaging the model in `skops`, I reduced security concerns while keeping compatibility. Streamlit made the interface development fast but required careful structuring of forms and results. Every part of the application is aligned with one principle: clarity for the end-user.
